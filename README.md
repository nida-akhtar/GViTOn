*Glasses Virtual Try On*

Used OpenCV to capture live video feeds and MediaPipe to accurately detect facial landmarks for overlay placement.
Integrated NumPy for efficient calculations to ensure the glasses fit naturally and scale correctly on different faces.
Implemented alpha blending to create realistic and seamless overlays of glasses on users' faces.
Designed an intuitive interface where users can choose from multiple glasses styles dynamically.
Learned and applied concepts in computer vision and improved Python skills while creating a smooth and responsive user experience.
